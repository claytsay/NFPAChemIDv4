/**
 * <h1>ChemProp</h1>
 * <h2>(Chemical Property Category, NFPA 704)</h2>
 * Specifies the three main properties identified by the NFPA 704 fire diamond.
 * <p>
 *     The properties are as follows:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li><code>HEALTH</code>: how toxic or poisonous the compound is (blue)</li>
 *         <li><code>FLAMMABILITY</code>: how flammable the compound is (red)</li>
 *         <li><code>REACTIVITY</code>: how reactive the compound is, apart from being flammable (yellow)</li>
 *     </ul>
 *     For each chemical, each property is ranked on a scale from 0 - 4, with 0 being least
 *     dangerous and 4 being most dangerous.
 *     Individual <code>enum</code> descriptions are taken from NFPA guidelines posted on Wikipedia.
